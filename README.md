Hypertension and socio-demography: using neural networks to predict high blood pressure from 
responses to the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing

Alexandros Dimitrios Nalmpantis, & Georgios Kyriakopoulos; (2017)

The present study explores two classes of neural computing algorithms 
(i.e. Support Vector Machines (SVMs); and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained with 
backpropagation) with regard to their accuracy in predicting self-reported hypertension 
based on survey data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The findings 
suggest that the performance of both algorithms declines when they are trained using 
inputs derived by applying Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) on the original inputs. Against 
our expectation, the findings suggest that SVMs outperform MLPs; however, only by a very 
small margin. Implications for the domain of social-science analytics are briefly considered.
